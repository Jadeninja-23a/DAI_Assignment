\section*{Question 3}

Bonferroni's inequality states that for two events \( A \) and \( B \):

\[P(A \cap B) \geq P(A) + P(B) - 1 \]

We know that \( P(A) \geq 1 - q_1 \) and \( P(B) \geq 1 - q_2\).
Thus, we can write:
\[P(A \cap B) \geq (1 - q_1) + (1 - q_2) - 1\]
\[P(A \cap B) \geq 1 - (q_1 + q_2)\]
 Hence, Proven that \( P(A \cap B) \geq 1 - (q_1 + q_2) \).

\section*{Question 4}

Labelling events: \\
 \begin{description}
\item[R]Event that a bus in town is red.
\item[B] Event that a bus in town in blue.
\item[SR] Event that the person sees red.
\item[SB] Event that the person sees blue.  
 \end{description}

Given : 

\[P(R) = 0.01\] 
\[P(B) = 0.99\] 
\[P(SR | R) = 0.99\]
\[P (SB | B) = 0.98\]
